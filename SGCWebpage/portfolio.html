The building directly in front is known
as Mckeldin Library, whereas the whole
field is named Mckeldin Mall. This is
where I go to study in my spare time, 
as well as relax during the day.

<p>
This is me at a power-themed event hosted by
the SGA at Stamp where guest speakers James
Stillwell and Anthony Torres came on and talked
about system change in our own society in order
to take steps for preventing climate change, as
well as recent progress and future measures that
need to be taken to prevent climate change.

<p>
I took a trip to visit the National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C. I went down to visit during the People's Climate Change March and got to see exhibits showcasing feats in aviation and explorations into space. I also got to see the
actual model of the U.S.S Enterprise used in Star Trek, which was very cool to see.

<p>
I got a chance to visit Bayfront Park to colect some fossils. The whole area was once a marine environment back in the early Miocene where most aquatic life lived, including early sharks. I collected some good shark teeth while I was there and later identified which shark they were on my way back to campus. I would definetly go back, it was a great trip.

I went to see a screening for a Viral-Themed event at the Cambridge Community Center.
We watched 28 Days Later and learned about how the movie's themes related to the
viral theme of this semester's events.
