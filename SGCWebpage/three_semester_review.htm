<h2><b>Jonathan Gorczyca's Three Semester Review</b></h2><p>
</p>

    
<p>
    Being apart of SGC for three semesters has allowed me to be more analytical when it comes to new and incoming information as the information becomes relevant. Over the course of a year I have been taught about many logical fallacies that still to this day affect our way of thinking in today’s society and ways to avoid making the same mistakes. Such ones include Observational Selection, or as most call it Cherry Picking in which specific data points are selected from data to support a certain viewpoint. Another one is Correlation Equals Causation, which is the misconception in which people think that because two things happened simultaneously, one event must have caused the other.  Then there is the Slippery Slope, which is described as refusing to accept a sound argument out of the fear that over many repetitions of accepting smaller ones will you eventually accept the final argument. 

These are just to name a few, but the reason why I list these is because I have experienced these most often when it came to my grandfather, who is sort of a Climate Change skeptic. We argued about Climate Change over the course of my three semesters with SGC and we still argue about it today. We bring it up every now and then casually.  Most of the time I’m there just to see if I can catch any logical fallacies that he might run into and try to counter it. One time I remember him making the claim that “The Earth always undergoes climate change” to which I knew he was running into Non-Comprehension of Statistics because he didn’t understand that the Earth’s average temperature in terms of rate these past few years has mirrored that of past extinctions and not climate change as it happens normally. He also tried to say climate change is not anthropogenic, rattling off volcanoes and the sun as possible causes, which meant that he ran into the Correlation Equals Causation fallacy. I caught him making an Argument From Ignorance when he said “Scientists don’t have the measurements for climate change before on-the-books recording began, so how can we justify Climate Change” to which I did indeed show him the data since we do have those measurements. When it came to the Slippery Slope, he fell into it at first, but once I started actually showing him the data for it, he started to see my side of the argument a little. He doesn’t trust data from the scientific community for a fair reason, the fact that science always changes, but I always tell him it’s to get closer to the right answer and that I would much prefer that than having all the answers with the possibility of them all being wrong. We each respect each other’s viewpoints and I love my grandfather. The most important thing I took away from that experience was being able to see these fallacies as they play out and being able to recognize each one, which is a skill I will hold for the rest of my life and one that I am grateful for.

	Besides my grandfather, I don’t believe I have had any other encounters with challenging beliefs during my three semesters of SGC.

Attending class was also a big part of my experience. All of the lectures, especially the pseudoscience ones, were very interesting and always kept me intrigued and entertained. When it came to the projects, I felt as though they did well at conveying information to us because they were never too much work and they were very clear about how it related to the class topic, so the big picture was always in mind when it came to each assignment. One project in particular really stood out to me out of all the others though. It was actually our most recent one in which groups were assigned a Climate Change practical solution to research and present about. Seeing all the computational engineering and careful thought that must have been put into developing all these awesome technologies really made me proud to be a Computer Science Major. And out of all the myriad projects I thought the TerpConnect webpage would be the one, but this project had a lot more to offer. I got to learn about Compressed Air Technology, Tidal and Wave Generation of Electricity, and much more cool technologies that made me connect more with my major. The presentations allowed me to see what technologies I could be developing once I graduate, which helped me to see the science side of my major and its options. The one that really impressed me the most was the Smart Grid, which involved using a complex algorithm to efficiently distribute electricity when most needed. I never knew such a thing existed before watching that presentation and I was instantly hooked. Unfortunately it is purely hypothetical but it definitely enhanced my attitude about Computer Science. Not only did it use concepts that I was already learning and could understand, but also it was being used to help communities and save on excess emissions and saving the planet. It really opened my eyes in terms of the extent of what Computer Science could be for the Earth. Who knows how else we could save the planet with computers if we just ran things more efficiently.

	Being in GEOL204 and all of my Computer Science courses has also helped me to understand a lot about what the program teaches. For example, GEOL204 has taught me about the geological history of Earth’s mass extinction events and how many of them have implications of present global change. In Computer Science, I have ascertained the skills required to build future technologies for the ongoing climate change that still affects us today. Such classes and more help me in preparing for the future and to formulate my decisions based on the skills I have developed and the knowledge I have acquired. 

And my understanding of what SGC has taught me didn’t stop there. I had friends in SGC who helped me along the way. Two of my best friends in college I met because we were in the same class and had lots of fun together doing projects. Just about every assignment we did this semester was us all together as a team, which helped me in excelling at the program because I had good dependable friends who I had good chemistry with.  I remember doing the Impacts of Global Change project with them and having no troubles with scheduling or conflicts. In fact, it was almost as if we weren’t doing work when I was with them because we did it together as friends and not partners, which made the project all the more important and engaging. I would have not done well in this course without them and I’m glad I got to know them.

I feel as though my personal contribution to the community of SGC was being apart of all the field trips and connecting SGC members with others on each trip starting with the very first one: the Scavenger Hunt. I got to meet up with Josiah, Kyle, and others and had an amazing time hanging out with them. We branched out to others and quickly brought a lot of members closer together the more we walked and talked in downtown D.C. I have since made lasting friendships with some of those individuals and have never felt more like a community member interacting with my fellow SGC members that day and was a trip I will always remember. I recall connecting with some of the members who didn’t get along well with other members like my roommate who I didn’t know too much until I encouraged him to go on a self guided field trip with me to the Aerospace Museum in D.C. I got to know him a lot more that day and ever since he has been more open with me and other SGC members whenever I’m in class sitting next to him. He has since come out of his shell more and I couldn’t be happier with him. I remember catching up with another kid during the Chesapeake Beach in a similar way and having a great time finding shark teeth with him.

And into the future onward, I will remember the lessons I have learned and the friends I have made these past three semesters. I will continue to protect myself against logical fallacies, distinguish between science and pseudoscience, and never stop learning. These teachings will aid me in formulating opinions and making stances on viewpoints for myself going into the future outside of college. I feel as though these tools are essential to being my own person, so as not fall victim to traps when it comes to accepting views blindly without evidence. I hope that I can educate others on Climate Change and the future ramifications that it has on our lives as SGC has taught me last semester. I hope to maintain the charisma and drive to keep learning all I can about my major going into my career as a software engineer, as SGC has taught me to love learning through the various lectures I have come to appreciate. In all, I don’t want my time in SGC to go to waste. I will never forget my time in SGC and I believe that these next few years will open up a whole new world for me in terms of how I view the world from here on out.
